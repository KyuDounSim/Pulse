The establishment of the PSKL served as recognition of HKUSTs research achievements in the field. It would also act as a key platform to strengthen collaborations and academic exchanges between Mainland and international institutions to boost technological advancement in Hong Kong and the country at large. \n\nChina has made great efforts to promote the display industry over past years, and has included it in the national 12th Five-Year Plan. Displays are the fourth largest import in China. However, few universities or research institutions in China focus on display research. The new PSKL will build on the work of HKUSTs Center for Display Research and its track record of achievements. Established in 1995, researchers at the Center have published over 2,000 journal articles related to display research, and successfully obtained more than 100 and 60 patents in the US and China respectively. The PSKL will also serve as a key platform for HKUST and Sun Yat-Sen University to boost innovation and nurture talents.\n\nBasic and applied research projects at the PSKL will concentrate on five main areas: oxide thin film transistors (TFT) array technology; third generation organic LED (OLED) devices; liquid crystal display (LCD) devices; video signal processing; IC design; and frontier technologies. One major task for the PSKL is to develop energy-saving green displays. This will include active matrix organic light emitting diodes (AMOLED) displays. The PSKL will also provide training programs and short courses for Chinese enterprises, and hold seminars and international conferences with other institutions.\n\nProf Hoi-sing Kwok, Chair Professor of HKUST's Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, and Dr William M W Mong Professor of Nanotechnology, has been appointed Director of the PSKL. Twenty-three senior engineering and science faculty members from HKUST will carry out research at the PSKL, including the \"Father of OLED\" and member of the US National Academy of Engineering Prof Ching Tang, five IEEE Fellows, three Fellows of the American Physical Society, a Fellow of the Optical Society of America, and a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nProf Kwok said: \"HKUST has been carrying out leading research on display technology, with its top research team and world-class facilities.
